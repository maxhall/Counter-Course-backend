# Counter-Course-backend
An experimental Flask API for university subject review site. Significant WIP.

## Installation for Development
1. Download the repository
2. Make sure you have `Python` and `Virtual Environment` installed.
3. Head to the project directory and run `virtualenv env` to set up the virtual environment (an "env" folder with the new python environment will be created).
4. Run the `./env/lib/activate` script to activate the environment. This will cause your console to treat the project folder as its root.
5. Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install the dependencies we need from the requirements.txt file.
6. Start the local server by typing `run.py`
5. Point your browser to localhost:5000 and enjoy.

Fair warning, this thing isn't at all functional at the moment. Or working for that matter.
