# Counter-Course-backend
An experimental Flask API for university subject review site. Significant WIP.

## Installation for Development
1. Download the repository
2. Make sure you have Python and Virtual Environment installed.
3. Head to the project directory and run `python setup.py`. This will set up the virtual environment (the 'env' folder) and install all the dependencies.
4. Start the server by typing `./env/lib/python run.py`
5. Point your browser to localhost:5000 and enjoy.

Fair warning, this thing isn't at all functional at the moment. Or working for that matter.
